TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无监督聚类的HFO自动检测方法，在80-500Hz频段内区分HFO事件与尖波、背景活动和伪影，在控制数据集上达到97.67%的灵敏度和98.57%的精确度。

Motivation: 高频振荡（HFOs）是识别癫痫灶的新生物标志物，但视觉识别HFOs耗时、费力且主观，需要开发自动化检测方法用于研究和临床。

Method: 使用S变换从时频域提取事件，采用无监督聚类技术对事件进行分类，区分HFOs与尖波、背景活动和伪影。

Result: 在控制数据集上灵敏度97.67%、精确度98.57%、F分数97.78%；在癫痫患者中，切除与非切除接触点的HFOs比率与手术结果相关性更强（0.73）。

Conclusion: HFOs是癫痫患者癫痫发生性的有前景生物标志物，切除HFOs（特别是快速波纹）可导致无癫痫发作，而残留HFOs则导致癫痫复发。

Abstract: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a new biomarker for identifying the
epileptogenic zone. Mapping HFO-generating regions can improve the precision of
resection sites in patients with refractory epilepsy. However, detecting HFOs
remains challenging, and their clinical features are not yet fully defined.
Visual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
subjective. As a result, developing automated methods to detect HFOs is
critical for research and clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel
method for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500
Hz). We validated it using both controlled datasets and data from epilepsy
patients. Our method employs an unsupervised clustering technique to categorize
events extracted from the time-frequency domain using the S-transform. The
proposed detector differentiates HFOs events from spikes, background activity,
and artifacts. Compared to existing detectors, our method achieved a
sensitivity of 97.67%, a precision of 98.57%, and an F-score of 97.78% on the
controlled dataset. In epilepsy patients, our results showed a stronger
correlation with surgical outcomes, with a ratio of 0.73 between HFOs rates in
resected versus non-resected contacts. The study confirmed previous findings
that HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity in epileptic patients.
Removing HFOs, especially fast ripple, leads to seizure freedom, while
remaining HFOs lead to seizure recurrence.
