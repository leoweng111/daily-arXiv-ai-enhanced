Mapping HFO-generating regions can improve the precision of\nresection sites in patients with refractory epilepsy. However, detecting HFOs\nremains challenging, and their clinical features are not yet fully defined.\nVisual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and\nsubjective. As a result, developing automated methods to detect HFOs is\ncritical for research and clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel\nmethod for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500\nHz). We validated it using both controlled datasets and data from epilepsy\npatients. Our method employs an unsupervised clustering technique to categorize\nevents extracted from the time-frequency domain using the S-transform. The\nproposed detector differentiates HFOs events from spikes, background activity,\nand artifacts. Compared to existing detectors, our method achieved a\nsensitivity of 97.67%, a precision of 98.57%, and an F-score of 97.78% on the\ncontrolled dataset. In epilepsy patients, our results showed a stronger\ncorrelation with surgical outcomes, with a ratio of 0.73 between HFOs rates in\nresected versus non-resected contacts. The study confirmed previous findings\nthat HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity in epileptic patients.\nRemoving HFOs, especially fast ripple, leads to seizure freedom, while\nremaining HFOs lead to seizure recurrence."}
